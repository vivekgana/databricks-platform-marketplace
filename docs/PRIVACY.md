# Privacy Notice

This repository is maintained by VivekGana. The plugins do not collect or store user data beyond what is required to execute commands against your Databricks workspace. Any credentials (for example `DATABRICKS_HOST` and `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`) remain in your environment and are only used to make requests you initiate. No telemetry is sent to VivekGana by default.

For support questions or data concerns, open an issue in the repository discussions or contact support@vivekgana.com.
